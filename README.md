# Macrokeyboard with Raspberry Pi Pico

## Overview
This project is my first experience in CAD for 3D modeling and printing and also my first experience in PCB design and manufacturing. It involves creating a macrokeyboard with **9 keys** and **2 knobs** using a **Raspberry Pi Pico** microcontroller. The custom PCB was designed using **KiCad**.

## Features
- **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi Pico
- **Inputs:** 
  - 9 Keys
  - 2 Knobs (Rotary Encoders)
- **Software:** Python on Raspberry Pi Pico

## PCB Design
The PCB was custom-designed using KiCad.
